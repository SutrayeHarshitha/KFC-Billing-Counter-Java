The KFCBillingSystem class manages a simple KFC restaurant billing system. It features:

Menu Management: Initializes a menu with item names and prices.
Order Processing: Allows users to place orders by entering item names until "done" is typed.
Payment Handling: Accepts user payment and checks if it's sufficient to cover the total. It handles insufficient payments by prompting the user to try again.
Bill Generation: Generates and displays a bill with a token number and counter assignment for order pickup.
In the main method, the system displays the menu, takes the order, processes payment, and generates the bill.
